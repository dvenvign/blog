Hi! I'm Dennis Verweij and I'm the lead platform engineer at Pon Digital Solutions. Pon Digital Solutions builds and runs websites, mobile apps, webshops, integrations and api's. We have a best of breed philosophy on what, where and how to run things so a pretty broad skillset and an open mind is required to not go mad. We run on GCP, AWS, Azure and we use tech like kubernetes, istio, cloudflare, elasticsearch, mongodb, mysql, postgres, mulesoft.....and a lot more. 

I've been working in IT for about 19 years now and have seen pretty much all of it. Where in the past I was mostly busy with system enginering, work turned more and more to software enginering. 

At the time I was working with Windows systems my coding language of choice was Powershell. Started with that when it was still called Monad and Jeffrey Snover pushed it out in the open. Later when moving more to linux systems, Python and Ruby where a logical choice until......

...until I came across Go. That was love at first sight. It's clean, fast to build, simple to write, easy to read and with a really powerfull standard library. Now when I need something done you know what the codebase will be like...

They say that sharing is caring and that's the biggest reason for me to start this blog. The annoying thing I often see in blogs is that they tell you the nice and simple story and stop right where it gets hard. I don't know why, but let's leave that reason aside (easy scoring, copying manuals or the stupid idea of knowledge is power) I'll try my best to give some real-live examples based on my experience along the way.
